# inf4375-tp3-frontend

a simple React one page app design to sit on the [RESTful web service](https://github.com/simongarnier/inf4375/tree/tp3) I wrote in a previous assignment for my delightful web class.

# Installation and usage

First you will need to start this [web service](https://github.com/simongarnier/inf4375/tree/tp3). Instructions are in the repo and the service need to listen on port 3000, but it's the default setting

For the dependency management of the one page app, you will need [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you're up and running just :

    $ npm install

and then :

    $ npm start

The app server will listen on port 8080, so [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) should do the trick. If you want to change the port, just look into `./package.js`.
